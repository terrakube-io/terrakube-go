{"id":"tkgo-9th","title":"Audit Terrakube API coverage gaps in Go client","description":"Assess the full Terrakube API surface area against the current Go client library and identify which APIs are missing. The current client covers 22 resource services: Organizations, Workspaces, Modules, Teams, TeamTokens, Variables, OrganizationVariables, Templates, Tags, VCS, SSH, Agents, Collections, CollectionItems, CollectionReferences, WorkspaceTags, WorkspaceAccess, WorkspaceSchedules, Webhooks, WebhookEvents, History, and Jobs. This audit needs to discover all Terrakube REST API endpoints from their documentation/source code (https://github.com/AzBuilder/terrakube), catalog current coverage, and produce a gap analysis with priority recommendations for missing resources.","design":"Approach: (1) Pull Terrakube API controller/route definitions from AzBuilder/terrakube GitHub repo to enumerate all REST endpoints. (2) Cross-reference against the 22 services in client.go. (3) Categorize gaps by resource type (CRUD operations, relationships, special endpoints). (4) Prioritize based on Terraform provider usage patterns and common automation needs.","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Full list of Terrakube API endpoints documented (from Terrakube source/docs)\n- [ ] Current Go client coverage mapped against API surface\n- [ ] Gap analysis produced listing missing resources/endpoints\n- [ ] Each gap prioritized (P0-P4) based on typical client usage\n- [ ] Recommendations documented for implementation order\n- [ ] Results captured in a bead or linked document for future implementation tracking","notes":"Terrakube uses JSON:API spec. Source repo: https://github.com/AzBuilder/terrakube. The Go client uses google/jsonapi for serialization. Some endpoints (like TeamToken) use raw JSON instead of JSON:API format - watch for similar patterns in undiscovered endpoints.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"dwebb@thig.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T08:46:54.109928-06:00","created_by":"dwebb","updated_at":"2026-02-11T08:46:54.109928-06:00","labels":["groomed"]}
